# VLLMD-Hypervisor System Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the VLLMD KVM virtualization system,
focusing on enhancements, new features, and long-term architecture goals.

## Precheck System

### Current State

The precheck system provides a comprehensive verification of system readiness for VLLMD
virtualization, covering hardware, software, kernel features, and security aspects.

### Assessment Feature

- [ ] **Configuration Rating System**

    - Implement a numeric scoring system (0-100%) for each subsystem
    - Provide an overall system readiness score
    - Visual indicators for optimal/suboptimal configurations
    - Generate machine-readable output (JSON) for automation

- [ ] **Differential Analysis**

    - Compare system configuration against known-good reference configurations
    - Highlight deviations from optimal settings
    - Categorize issues by severity (critical/warning/info)
    - Track configuration improvements over time

- [ ] **Performance Impact Estimation**
    - Estimate performance impact of suboptimal configurations
    - Model expected throughput based on configuration scores
    - Provide quantitative metrics for each configuration element

### Detailed Reporting

- [ ] **Enhanced Topology Visualization**

    - Generate visual representation of NUMA topology
    - Map PCIe devices to NUMA nodes with bandwidth indicators
    - Visualize IOMMU group relationships
    - Show memory access paths between devices and CPUs

- [ ] **Resource Utilization Analysis**

    - Analyze current resource allocation efficiency
    - Identify NUMA locality optimizations
    - Highlight memory bandwidth bottlenecks
    - Model optimal CPU affinity settings

- [ ] **Configuration Recommendation Engine**
    - Generate specific kernel parameter recommendations
    - Provide exact commands to implement recommended changes
    - Prioritize recommendations by performance impact
    - Include explanation of trade-offs for each recommendation

### Security-Specific Configuration

- [ ] **Security Posture Assessment**

    - Evaluate overall security stance of virtualization environment
    - Score isolation effectiveness for multi-tenant configurations
    - Detect potential side-channel vulnerabilities
    - Analyze firmware security features (SMM, UEFI Secure Boot)

- [ ] **DMA Protection Analysis**

    - Verify IOMMU coverage for all PCIe devices
    - Test for DMA access violations
    - Analyze potential DMA attack vectors
    - Assess firmware-level DMA protections

- [ ] **Sandboxing Verification**

    - Validate completeness of VM sandboxing
    - Check for privileged capabilities granted to VMs
    - Verify memory isolation between VMs
    - Analyze potential privilege escalation paths

- [ ] **Security vs. Performance Optimizer**
    - Recommend balanced security/performance configurations
    - Provide tiered security profiles (standard/enhanced/maximum)
    - Allow customization of security/performance balance
    - Document security implications of performance optimizations

## Core System Enhancements

### VM Lifecycle Management

- [ ] **Template-based VM Creation**
- [ ] **Live Migration Support**
- [ ] **Checkpoint/Restore Functionality**

### Resource Optimization

- [ ] **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
- [ ] **Memory Overcommit with Ballooning**
- [ ] **Machine Learning-based Resource Prediction**

### Monitoring and Telemetry
